# Foreign-Affairs-Calendar
A multitude of .ics files that track various things that may be of use to someone in Foreign Affairs, with a specific focus on Congress' role in foreign policy development.

It's aim to have multiple sub calendars by topic (elections, hearings, holidays, etc) that can be merged into one master calendar. 

# Current Ideas

National holidays (independence days, etc), election monitoring, Congressional hearings, and Think Tank/policy events.
